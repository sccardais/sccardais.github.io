This is an example of a website created by https://enzostvs-deepsite.hf.space. The site is powered by the DeepSeek AI and is hosted at Hugging Face. 

The site creates websites and web-apps based entirely on text prompts. I decided to experiment with it using the prompt below: 
"create a website for a non-profit organization created to enhance the appearance of a downtown park and to increase its utilization by local residents"

 In a sidebar window on the left side of the screen, it immediately started to write html code. The results appeared in real time on the right side of my screen.

 It was pretty amazing.
